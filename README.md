Shopify custom section built as part of a recruitment process test for [Battalion](https://wearebattalion.com/).
Battalion provided me a Figma mockup and the following functional requirements:

- Section product, title, subtitle and hyperlink should be dynamically set in the section settings
- Card dropdown should display all product variants and dynamically update card values based on selected variant
- Card image should display variant **featured image**
- Card should display variant **title**
- Card should display variant custom metafield **subtitle**
- Card should display variant **prices**
- Card should include two **hyperlinks** to product with the variant selected
- Card should display variant custom **metaobjects with and image, title and description**
